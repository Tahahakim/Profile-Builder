         <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;I am a dedicated and passionate Computer Science graduate from the S.G.Balekundri Institute of Technologies, belgaum , india
                 where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a CGPA of 8.0. My academic journey has been marked by a deep interest in software development and systems architecture,
                  reflected in my hands-on experience with projects such as a Bus Tracking System that integrates GPS technology and mobile app development. 
                  This project not only enhanced my technical skills in backend development using Firebase but also ignited my passion for building solutions that improve everyday experiences.</p><br>
        
            <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong foundation in DevOps practices, gained through my internship at Google Cloud, where I contributed to automating CI/CD pipelines
                   and managing Kubernetes clusters. I am proficient in a range of tools and technologies, including AWS, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform, and monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana.
                   My ability to collaborate effectively within cross-functional teams has allowed me to streamline processes and enhance productivity.</p><br>
                   
            <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;Beyond academics and technical skills, I am also passionate about sports, having achieved recognition as a captain of my varsity soccer team and participating in various sports activities. 
                    My well-rounded background demonstrates not only my commitment to excellence in academics but also my ability to lead and work collaboratively in diverse environments. 
                    Additionally, my experience in anchoring matches has refined my communication skills, making me an effective presenter and team player.</p><br>

            <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences in a dynamic role that allows me to contribute to innovative projects while continuing to grow professionally in the tech industry.</p>
